## Installation

1. Node.js is installed from the website, https://www.nodejs.org. 

2. Node Package Manager (npm) is a software manager and installer which puts the modules in 
   place so that the node project can utilize it, and also, it manages dependency conflicts intelligently.

3. The application is initialized using <strong>npm init</strong>.
                 
4. During the installation process, the user will be asked to input some information about the 
   project.  The package.json will be generated in our folder after initialization of npm.  This package.json file contains all the details of the application in which the user have inputted during the npm initialization.

5. This application requires the installation of express framework which is done by this  
   command prompt at the system terminal, npm install express --save.     
    
6. Body-Parser installation is installed by using npm install body-parser -- save at
   system terminal. Body-Parser is node.js middleware that parses incoming/user request bodies in a middleware before the handlers.

7. Nodemon is installed as development dependency meaning that if our application 
   ever goes in production, this package will not be included.  The command to install nodemon for this case is npm i -D nodemon.
 
   The purpose of this package is to watch for any changes in our files and restart the server instead of us having to do that manually ourselves.
